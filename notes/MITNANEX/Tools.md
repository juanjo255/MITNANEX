> This document is to annotate tools to review in order to know more about the state of art of tools meant to manage mitochondrial DNA in different ways.
> Tools are classified into two types of strategies: **seed-based** and **seed-free**. Also, we will review useful tools that do not fit into these categories due to their purpose. Those are ranked into 'Others'.

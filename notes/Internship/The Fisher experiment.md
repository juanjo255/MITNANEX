#ExperimentalDesign

+ This document does not described the experimental design itself. It is more a report of the advatages that this approach could have over the "traditional" approach.

+ If this proposal is approved or taking into account, the idea with the experimental design would be built it from the same template established for the "traditional" approach, but with a few differences. 

+ Here I refer to the normal or traditional experiment as the "alternative experiment" and to my proposal as the "randomized experiment".

+ Name was born in honor to Ronal Fisher a great biostatistics and pioneer in aplication of randomization in experimental design.


## Key points

+ This section describes the points that makes this proposal different from the "alternate" one.

> 1. **Random use of lights:** This method is used for train the mice in the alternate experiment. During this experiment they will to fulfill the same objective, except that they will to indicate the availability of a port not in an alternate behavior but a random behavior (the pair of ports to be open will be random).  
> 2. **Port use limit:** This method will add this new hyperparameter. This hyperparameter will limit the times a port can be use in a row, in such a way we would force the move of the mice. The parameter has to be established over a value of 2, otherwise we would repeating the behavior of the alternate experiment. This port limit will be taught even during the appearance of the light, that is, a pair of light cannot be turned on more than n in a row.
> 3. **Inter-trial interval:** This is the same hyperparameter as the alternate experiment, but, unlike the aforementioned, in this experiment will be use in the early stages, in order to give time mice to get away from the port and avoid the pattern presented in the alternate experiment but repeating ports (port use limit).

## Troubleshooting

+ This section describes the problems found so far with the Fisher experiment and a potential solution for each of them. The problems can belong to the alternate experiment or could emerged with the randomized experiment.

> 1. **Go-and-come pattern:** This problem can make the experiment questionable, given that between, for example, perforate and solid barrier there are barely differences (results with a solid performance of 59% and perforate performance of 59% during same stages), which does not seem being convincing, since basics statistics say that every mice pair by chance have only 25% of success in every trial (is it really social cooperation?). 
>> **Solution:** Random use of lights.
>> 	**Explanation:** Using random use of light we avoid inducing patterns in mice which overshadows social cooperation, if a pattern arised, it would be an independent learnt pattern.
> 2. **The lazy behavior:** This behavior can make questionable our experiment as much as the Go-and-come pattern, it concists of the mice sticking to a port just pocking their nose into the port reciving free water (is it really social cooperation?).
>> **Solution proposed:** Port use limit and Inter-trial interval.
>> 	**Explanation:** Port use limit will work to force mice to change ports so we can start seeing the cooperation to move to the other pair of ports. Inter-trial interval will try to prevent mice of being aware of a limited port use by setting a "long enough time" for the mouse get away from the port, in that way we could decrease the go-and-come pattern.


## Predictions

+ This section describes my predictions for this experiment. This is the base that support the prosperity of my proposal. Are my results different from the ones of the alternate experiment? What kind of result do I expect?

> 1. **Marked difference between perforate and solid barrier:** Given the decrease of the ease to grasp a pattern, I would expect a worst performance in the solid barrier, since would be harder to synchronize their movements.

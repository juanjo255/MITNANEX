* # **CURIOUS DATA OF MITOCHONDRIAL GENOMIC**

	- ## Genetic aspects of mitochondrial genome evolution (2013)
		- Compared with other mitochondrial genome metazoan's are massevily reduce in their genetic structure.
		- A typical metazoan mitogenome consists of a single circular DNA that carries **13** intron-less protein coding genes, the **2** subunits of the mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, and **22** tRNAs, one for each amino acid except leucine and serine, which have two copies each.

# MITNANEX PROJECT

MITochondrial NANopore reads EXtrator

This is intended to be a extractor for mitocondrial nanopore reads from the whole genome sequencing, in order to be able to assembly mitogenome or do any other proccess where researchers think mitocrondrial reads could be useful.

Status: In development

Steps achieved: 
 + Filtering NCBI databases to retrieve Nanopore mitogenomes and their corresponding Nanopore reads for validation (benchmarking).
 + Gathering of literature about mitochondrial mitogenome biology and tools state of art of mito-tools.  

Next Step: 
 + Assess possible approaches.

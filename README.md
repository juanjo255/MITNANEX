This is intended to be a extractor for mitocondrial nanopore reads from the whole genome sequencing, in order to be able to assembly mitogenome or do any other proccess where researchers think mitocrondrial reads could be useful.

Status: In development

Steps achieved: 
+ Retrieve mitochondrial reads
+ Assemble a draft genome using retrieved data
+ Given the draft assembly collect more reads

Next Step: 
 + Correct reads
 + Retrieve final assembly and reads

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

# MITochondrial NANopore reads EXtrator

This is intended to be a extractor for mitocondrial nanopore reads from the whole genome sequencing, in order to be able to assembly mitogenome or do any other proccess where researchers think mitocrondrial reads could be useful.

Status: In development

Steps achieved: 
+ Retrieve mitochondrial reads
+ Assemble a draft genome using retrieved data
+ Given the draft assembly collect more reads

Next Step: 
 + Correct reads
 + Retrieve final assembly and reads

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This is intended to be a extractor for mitocondrial nanopore reads from the whole genome sequencing, in order to be able to assembly mitogenome or do any other proccess where researchers think mitocrondrial reads could be useful.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
The tool has a module written in Rust. I have to find out if it is necessary to download rust and/or run masturin
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

#### Conda/mamba

The best way to use the program is throught the beautiful conda enviroment 
Note this has been only tested on MacOS M1
```
mamba create --name mitnanex --file enviroment.yml
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.
